                                Education should bring out the perfection which is already present in each
                                child. An institution should provide an environment which helps the child in
                                achieving this perfection. It should help him develop his inherent qualities
                                and all the aspects of his personality. This can be achieved when those
                                involved in this process realize that education is much more than cramming
                                a lot of information and passing examinations based on rote learning.
